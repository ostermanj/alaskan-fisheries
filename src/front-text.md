Alaskan fisheries are highly interconnected, meaning that fishermen with permits to exploit one fishery are likely to have permits to fish in another. A fishery is defined by its combination of species, gear (such as gillnets or longlines), and location. For instance, the Salmon–Drift gillnet–Southeast fishery (S-3-A) shares a relatively large number of permit holders with the Dungeness crab–pot gear vessel under 60 feet–Southeast fishery (D-9-A). Any change in policy governing S-3-A is therefore likely to have spillover effects on D-9-A. The same propensity is present throughout the network of fisheries.

The work informing this feature uses the techniques of network analysis to describe and quantify the interconnectedness of the fisheries. Policymakers seeking to regulate or protect one fishery need to understand that interconnectedness to avoid negative consequences, protect fish resources, and safeguard fishing communities.

Explore the map above above to see the network-analysis results for each fishery, the cluster to which it belongs, and the network as a whole. The interactive shows which individual fisheries are most connected to others and which clusters are most tightly connected internally.
